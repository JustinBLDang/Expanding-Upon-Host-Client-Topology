# Expanding-Upon-Host-Client-Topology
Inspired from the [Byzantine Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault), my addition to the Host-Client Topology creates a solution for how developers can protect data integrity of games. The approach to handling data is similar to the Byzantine General's problem, where a majority vote is used to determine what is correct. The majority state that clients broadcast will be distributed. 

Here is a video demo:
